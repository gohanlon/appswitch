WHAT IS IT?
-----------

If you use shell scripts to automate macOS applications, you may need
to switch between applications.  You could use AppleScript via
osascript(1), but that can take several seconds for the script to
compile and execute - or you could use appswitch, which works almost
instantly.

Say you're launching an X11 application from Terminal but the X server
isn't in front when you need it.  Use appswitch to fix the problem.

Or, if you'd like a version of the ps(1) utility which understands the
concept of macOS applications, appswitch can help.

INSTALLATION
------------

The commands below install the 'appswitch' tool in /usr/local/bin,
which is in the default path.  You should subsequently be able to use
'appswitch' by typing its name.  If you wish to install it somewhere
else, modify the install line as appropriate.

% sudo /usr/bin/install -d -m 755 /usr/local /usr/local/bin
% sudo /usr/bin/install -d -m 755 /usr/local/share /usr/local/share/man
% sudo /usr/bin/install -d -m 755 /usr/local/share/man/man1
% sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin /usr/local/share/man /usr/local/share/man/man1
% sudo /usr/bin/install appswitch /usr/local/bin
% sudo /usr/bin/install -m 644 appswitch.1 /usr/local/share/man/man1
% rehash				# if necessary

Uninstallation:

% sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/appswitch /usr/local/man/man1/appswitch.1

COMPILATION
-----------

An Xcode project, 'appswitch.xcodeproj', is included.  A precompiled
binary is also provided.  'appswitch' was developed and tested under
macOS 10.13 with Xcode 9.0.

USAGE
-----

Just type 'appswitch' by itself to receive usage information.  See the
manual page (man appswitch) for more information.
