WHAT IS IT?
-----------

If you use shell scripts to automate Mac OS X applications, you may
need to switch between applications.  You could use AppleScript via
osascript(1), but that would take several seconds for the script to
compile and execute - or you could use appswitch, which works almost
instantly.

Say you're launching an X11 application from Terminal but the X server
isn't in front when you need it.  Use appswitch to fix the problem.

Or, if you'd like a version of the ps(1) utility which understands the
concept of OS X applications, appswitch can help.

INSTALLATION
------------

The commands below install the 'appswitch' tool in /usr/local/bin,
which is in the default path.  You should subsequently be able to use
'appswitch' by typing its name.  If you wish to install it somewhere
else, modify the install line as appropriate.

% sudo /usr/bin/install -d /usr/local/bin /usr/local/man/man1
% sudo /usr/bin/install -c build/appswitch /usr/local/bin
% sudo /usr/bin/install -c appswitch.1 /usr/local/man/man1
% rehash

Uninstallation:

% sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/appswitch

COMPILATION
-----------

A Project Builder project, 'appswitch.pbproj', is included.  A
precompiled binary is also provided.  'appswitch' was developed and
tested under Mac OS 10.2.4 with the December 2002 Developer Tools,
and does not require any additional software to build.

USAGE
-----

Just type 'appswitch' by itself to receive usage information.  See the
manual page (man appswitch) for more information.

If you're curious about the speed difference between appswitch and
other methods, this should give you some indication.

appswitch -a Emacs          0.00s user 0.02s system  5% cpu 0.355 total
appswitch -i com.gnu.Emacs  0.01s user 0.04s system 13% cpu 0.381 total
open -a Emacs               0.30s user 0.15s system 53% cpu 0.842 total
osascript -e 'tell application "Emacs" to activate'
                            0.66s user 0.42s system 45% cpu 2.361 total

The above tests were performed on a PowerBook G4/800; slower systems
should show more dramatic differences.
